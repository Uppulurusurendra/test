<p>As Bieber entered adulthood, his celebrity often overshadowed his music. His romantic relationships (with Selena Gomez, among others) and his occasional skirmishes with the law brought him considerable tabloid attention. His 2015 album Purpose found an audience beyond his youthful fan base, with each of its first three singles reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Also in 2015, Bieber contributed vocals to Jack Ü’s Grammy Award-winning electro-pop hit “Where Are Ü Now.” Collaborations with other musicians followed, resulting in several popular songs. In 2018 Bieber married model Hailey Baldwin, and their relationship inspired Changes (2020). His sixth studio album, Justice, was released in 2021.<As Bieber entered adulthood, his celebrity often overshadowed his music.
